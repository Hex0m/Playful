Hidden plot line / lore lmao
----------------------------------
Guy/girl gets lost (beginning of book)
Documents a bunch of useful things (Basics)
Finds friends who teach him stuff (multiplayer.json)
Protagonist gets sick, friends migrate away from him for their health and safety's sake (communication.json)
The world seems more hostile, things go wrong (safety.json)
Eventually learns about enchanting from intact village he eventually finds (enchanting.json)
Opens smaller portals (gateways) by channeling items and experience. (magic)





// Plot points
Creates the end dimension by channeling his clean experience + portal in the pursuit of curing himself
(At this point his disease paired with his desperate will to fix it by any means necessary has him looking a little funky)





Makes it back to the overworld. He's leaking black goo from all his dimension-creating and warping and shit
It's horrible winter, (or there's a horrible dragon!?)
but he sees he actually received mail from friends who've migrated underground for safety (they're still in danger from normal mobs)
(He traps the dragon in the end??) 
He goes to tell his friends, (they've built a whole city underground) eventually finds them, but has leaked SCULK all the way there (they're mortified at his appearance)
(Sculk is corrupted experience?)
(He infects his friends?) 
He tries to open another portal to the end dimension in a last ditch effort to find a cure, but by channeling infected, sculky experience instead, 
and it opens a whole world of SCULK instead (deeper and darker dimension)

(He and his friends become wardens)
The End
